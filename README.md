## :rocket: About Me :wave:

I'm Lachlan Stephen, a current student at [42 Adelaide](https://www.42adel.org.au/), and an aspiring **Software Engineer**. I've had experience as a **Front End Web Developer** for about 4 years, and am currently freelancing on the side of my studies for a couple of clients.

I love coding, and find great pleasure when you have solid functionality with beautiful design.

I'm inspired by the developers at [Active Theory](https://activetheory.net/), I think the work they do is absolutely incredible, and it would be a dream to work there! Check out their website and portfolio, you won't be disappointed.

_Currently working on_: Organising my professional profiles

_Currently learning about_: Multi-threaded programs in C, and three.js web development (active theory inspired)

I'm looking to collaborate on anything! I want to be challenged!

Ask me about fractals, football (soccer), life as a 42Adelaide Student, or anything in-between!
