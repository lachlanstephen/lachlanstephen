## :rocket: About Me :rocket:

I'm Lachlan Stephen, a current student at [42 Adelaide](https://www.42adel.org.au/), and an aspiring **Software Engineer**. I've had experience as a **Front End Web Developer** for about 3 years, and am currently freelancing on the side of my studies for a couple of clients.

I love coding, and find great pleasure when you have solid functionality with beautiful design.
